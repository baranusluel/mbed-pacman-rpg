 * this module is only included once in each compilation unit. This prevents
 * transitive dependencies from mistakenly including headers many times, and
 * can also prevent infinite #include loops due to circular dependencies.

 * Forward Declarations
 *
 * These declarations are for interface types that are private to the module,
 * but are needed for external interfaces. Without a definition, the compiler
 * (and therefore the user) does not have access to information about the
 * member variables, and so the members cannot be used directly from modules
 * that include this header. However, we do know that these structures are
 * valid, and we can use pointers to them. This technique allows hiding the
 * implementation details of the hash table module behind a clean public
 * interface.
