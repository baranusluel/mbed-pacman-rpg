# Mbed Pacman RPG
*RPG game project using mbed for ECE 2035 Fall 2018.*

This is an RPG game written in C for the ARM Mbed platform. It is Pacman-themed, and has a mini-game of Pacman as the main RPG quest.

The game was tested on a LPC1768 development board, wired up with peripheral components as shown in [this schematic](Circuit%20Schematic.pdf). The project can be compiled using `make`.
